## Discussion of the Flutter framework. 

**1. Language**:
The main difference of the Flutter framework to other discussed frameworks is that it introduces its own language called dart. Dart has similarities with java, so it does not introduce a radical new paradigm. However, it requires interface designers to learn a new syntax, which is a entry barrier. 

**2. Style**:
Other frameworks fall back directly to css for styling the UI. However, in this assignment, the styling of the UI widgets is already implicitly defined. 

**3. Object-based**:
The dart language establishes a object based paradigm for frontend development, which is different to popular frameworks like react.
